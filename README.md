# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
An analysis on Kickstarter data was accomplished to help an up and coming playwright, Louise, set up a crowdfunding campaign of her own for her play, Fever.  Louise intends to produce this play in the U.S.  The data used covered a span of about eight years.  At a quick glance, we see that Theater campaigns are popular in Kickstarter in the United States.

Let’s dive a little deeper.  There was a total of 912 Theater campaigns, and out of that, there were 671 campaigns for Plays specifically.  About 60% of the Plays campaigns were successful.  Most of the successful Play campaigns were launched between the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the year, specifically between May through August.

The data also shows that 75% Successful campaigns had a goal of $5,000 or less, while 75% of the Failed campaigns had a goal of $10,000 or less.  This means that most successful campaigns did not set goals of over $5,000.
---
One more observation from the data is that 100% of the Successful campaigns were “Spotlighted” by Kickstarter, while 0% of the Failed campaigns were not.
---
In summary, Louise has a better chance in running a successful Kickstarter campaign if she launches it in late spring, or early summer.  I would advise her to set a goal between $5,000 and $10,000 and maybe pay a little extra to get her campaign highlighted by Kickstarter.
