# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The following analysis shows how each Kickstarter campaign, specifically Theater and Plays, performed in relation to their launch date, as well as in relation to their goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### At a quick glance, we see that Theater Kickstarter campaigns overall had more successful campaigns than failed and canceled campaigns throughout the year.

### Diving into the Plays subcategory, we can see that as the goal is set higher, the less likely it is to succeed.  Most successful projects had goals of $10,000 or less.

### I created a Pivot Table & Pivot chart, as well as the countifs function and a Line graph to conduct my analysis. The first for the campaign outcomes in relation to launch date and the latter I used for outcomes in relation to their goals. I more had challenges in knowing Excel syntax and figuring out how to create the line graph.  In creating the Pivot Chart for Theater Outcomes vs Launch, Quarters and Years2 fields automically populated when I dragged Years to the Axis area.  A classmate had asked about it in Slack, so I went back to the conversation and found out that I was supposed to take those 2 fields out.  I also took a bit of time in figuring out how to use the countifs function.  I played the video that was provided in the lesson several times, and also did some trial and error until I arrived at the expected data.

## Results

- Based on the Outcomes vs Launch data, I can conclude that there are more Kickstarter Theater campaigns that are successful than failed campaigns in general. I can also conclude that the most successful campaigns start in mid to late spring, specifically in May.

- Based on the Outcomes vs Goals data, I can conlcude that most Kickstarter Plays campaigns that set goals of $10,000 or less were successful.  

- There other factors that may make a campaign successful, like how much it is marketed.

- I think a pivot table with a bar chart showing the relationship between outcomes in relation to if the campaigns were spotlighted, or marketed by Kickstarter, would be helpful.
